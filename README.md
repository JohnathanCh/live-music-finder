# Live Music Finder


Live Music Finder is a simple app meant to test our knowledge of Rails. The database is seeded with real bands, but we made up some of the festivals. You can use our search function to find musicians or festival names, that will both be listed under their specific header.

When you find a festival you like, you can add it to your list of events and it will persist on the backend as an association.
