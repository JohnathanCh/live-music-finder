# Live Music Finder

Live Music Finder is a simple app meant to test our knowledge of Rails. The database is seeded with real bands, but we made up some of the festivals.

## How it works
Create a profile providing a name, email, age and password. You have to provide all of these fields and enter an age either 18 or above to pass verification.

Upon Login a user is sent to their profile. This is empty at first, but will fill up with festivals and musicians based on which festivals 


You can use our search function to find musicians or festival names, that will both be listed under their specific header.

When you find a festival you like, you can add it to your list of events and it will persist on the backend as an association.
